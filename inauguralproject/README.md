*Inaugural Project*

This assignment contains a .ipynb which prints the codes based on the .py file. The assignment concerns a theoretical model of how a household with a male and a female member allocates time between working in the market and performing home production. The goal is to maximize joint utility, subject to constraints on total consumption and the number of hours available in a day. In this assignment we plot the relative wages for varying alpha and sigma values, and plot the log of the relative hours working at home against log of the relative wages for women and men. This is done both in a discrete setup and a continuous setup to look at the different results from the different model setups. At last we compare our model to a model from a research paper by Siminski and Yetsenga from 2022, named "Specialization, Comparative Advantage, and the Sexual Division of Labor".
