# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Solow.Human** and is centered around the Solow model. First we introduce a standard model, and solve it analytically and numerically to build a foundation of our analysis. We then extend the solow model to include human capital, and notice that this can't be solved analytically and hence we turn our focus to solving it numerically. After solving the model we show the results in a phase diagram, and look at how an increase in the savings rate for human capital affect physical capital and human capital in steady state. Afterwards try to solve the solow model in a CES production function, which again is solely done with a numerical analysis. We then focuses on how the $\sigma$, substitutability of factors, affect physical capital and human capital in steady state. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [Solow.Human.ipynb](Solow.Human.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
