1. Inaugural Project. 
This project is about solving and simulating a pre-specified economic model and visualize the results. The economic model considers a household with a male and female member, jointly maximizing utiliy by choosing their time use. In this project we investigate relative wage and relative hours working at home in both a discrete and continuous time setting. In addition we look at a model from Siminski and Yetsenga (2022), and introduce and extension to the model.

2. Data Project. 
Data project has the purpose of loading and structuring data. In this project we examine the Premier League 2022/23 fixtures, and by statistics from the played matches so far in the season, we try to predict results for upcoming matches.

3. Model Project. 
Model project has the purpose of applying numerical model analysis methods and structuring a code project. Our model projects considers the Solow Model, first the general Solow Model, and later on extensions to the model. First we look at the Solow Model with human capital, and later at the same model but this with a CES production function.
